## What is TTL?

Time to Live (TTL) represents to number of 'hops' a packet can take before it is considered invalid. For Windows/Windows Phone, this value is 128. This value is 64 for Linux/Android.

## Why Change this value at all?

Some ISP prohibit 'tethering' your phone to another device. By changing TTL value to 65, the carriers must think you're using the phone, not the device it's tethered to.
